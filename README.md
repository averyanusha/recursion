This is a chapter of The Odin Project which is focusing on computer science. 
This particular project was about recursion. 
To create a function that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array 
To create the fundamental mergeSort function that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], and an input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].
